>>> Generating documentation from the code
	
	Swagger and OpenAPI
	- Swagger specification in 2011
	- OpenAPI specification was built in 2016
	- swagger ui: visualize and interact with api
	
	just add the dependency in the pom.xml and go to below link
	(http://localhost:8082/swagger-ui.html) 	
	
	
>>> Content negotiation

	XML and JSON support: any api user might expect
	OR we might also want the result to go out in multiple different languages(french, hindi etc)
	
	- to add the xml support:
		we only need to add the dependency
		com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat -> jackson-dataformat-xml
		
		##THIS CAN SOMETIMES CREATE ISSUES WITH THE ADVANCED FEATURES	
		
	- to add support to multiple languages: internationalization : i18n
		we have accept-language header
		
		to do this, we need to add messages.properties file in the resources folder
